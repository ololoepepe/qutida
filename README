However, there may be some slight differences on Mac OS X due to
technical features of the platform.

COMPILING qutida

To compile the application, you first need to get Qt libraries version 4.7.2
or later. Then type "cd <path_to_source_code>" in your terminal (command line)
and put the command: qmake -o Makefile qutida.pro
Then type "make" or "nmake" depending on the compiler you use.

For Visual Studio users, qmake can also generate .dsp or .vcproj files, for example:
qmake -tp vc qutida.pro
