You may post bug reports or comments there.

qutida is based on Qt 4.7.2 libraries, which are required to compile the
source code. You can download the latest Qt libraries at http://qt.nokia.com/

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The application will probably work fine on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
However, there may be some slight differences on Mac OS X due to
technical features of the platform.

COMPILING qutida

To compile the application, you first need to get Qt libraries version 4.7.2
or later. Then type "cd <path_to_source_code>" in your terminal (command line)
and put the command: qmake -o Makefile qutida.pro
Then type "make" or "nmake" depending on the compiler you use.

For Visual Studio users, qmake can also generate .dsp or .vcproj files,
for example: qmake -tp vc qutida.pro

For more information, see http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qmake-tutorial.html

USEFUL INFO

qutida supports command line arguments, which may be passed to the application
when it is launched. The list of arguments with descriptions is given below.

"-multiple" is useful when you want to launch more than one instance
of qutida at the same time. By default, only one instance is allowed,
and the "-multiple" argument cancels this limitation.

"-urls [url_1] [url_2] ..." tells the application to add threads with given
URLs at launch time. The arguments below are used to customize this procedure.

"-default" If this argument is passed along with the "-urls" argument, then
default parameters will be used for every new thread from the list, so
they will be added "silently". Otherwise, the "Add threads" dialog
will be shown, containling the list of new URLs. That allows you to modify
thread parameters before download starts.

"-start" This argument only makes sense if the "-default" argument is passed.
This combination tells the program to add new threads with default parameters
and to start downloading them immediately without any dialogs being shown.
